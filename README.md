# waf based on rust

两个月没更，主要为了西部计划和三支一扶，估计都要寄，害，无所谓了

`openssl` & `bison` & `flex` & `libpcap` & `python-requests` needed(maybe)

`sqlmap` needed

`iptables` or `firewalld` needed

```rustup toolchain install nightly```

make sure that you've been able to connect to the bak_server by `ssh-key` before using the `restore` module

# how to use

`cargo run [OPTIONS] <args>...`

Options:

    -- -h           Show basic help message and exit
    -- -m           Run rwaf/src/main.rs, and the pid will be stored in src/tmp/get_pid
    -- -re          Run rwaf/src/modules/restore/make_restore.rs, Manually execute the restore procedure
    -- -ct          Run rwaf/src/modules/counterattack/syn_flood.rs, Manually execute the counterattack procedure

ARGS:

    <args>...       If the [OPTIONS] is '-- -ct': 
                        the 1st [args] will be the target's IPv4 address and port, like '127.0.0.1:1234',
                        the 2nd [args] will be the number of threads, like: '100', the program will run in 100 threads

## for example

`cargo run -- -h`
